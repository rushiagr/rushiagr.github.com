    <h1 class="post-title">Plight of Online Banking in India</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Nov 9, 2014</span>
    
    

<p>So India is moving ahead. Industry is growing, common facilities are improving,
conditions for living are improving (or so it seems from a middle class guy&rsquo;s
eyes). Banks are becoming more accessible, and easier to use. All banks now
have online banking facility, and makes it less of a hassle to transact - now
you can sit at home and pay your bills, buy things, transfer money to friends
or parents, etc. But, after using online banking for about 4 years, I feel
there is a lot still to be achieved. I find it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;very very&rsquo; convenient.
Online banking experience can be made much much better by fixing these issues.
Below I&rsquo;m writing about my experiences with some of the Indian banks I&rsquo;ve done
online banking with.</p>

<h2 id="state-bank-of-india:8e2dd647e7d0560715f28db5fe7e69c3">State Bank of India</h2>

<p>Hands down India&rsquo;s largest bank. But the user interface of the online website
haven&rsquo;t changed much in the last 4 years I&rsquo;ve seen. There are quite a few
problems with the way the site behaves.</p>

<h4 id="immediate-transfer:8e2dd647e7d0560715f28db5fe7e69c3">Immediate transfer</h4>

<p>The rules of beneficiary addition, and
money transfer are outdated. You can&rsquo;t transfer any amount within the first 24
hours of beneficiary addition. It&rsquo;s Painful that you cannot add a
beneficiary immediately. Beneficiary addition and approval can take upto 24
hours, and I&rsquo;ve seen it taking 4+ hours all the time. If you want to transfer
money immediately, you&rsquo;re out of luck!</p>

<h4 id="imps-is-not-really-immediate:8e2dd647e7d0560715f28db5fe7e69c3">IMPS is not really &lsquo;Immediate&rsquo;</h4>

<p>IMPS was introduced as a faster &lsquo;NEFT&rsquo; &ndash; to work around the limitation that
NEFT transfer cannot be done outside bank working hours, so that you can
transact round the clock. Frustratingly, SBI&rsquo;s IMPS works only till 8PM. You
cannot transfer money after 8PM!</p>

<p>If that was not all, beneficiary addition is separate for NEFT and IMPS. So you
have to add your friend/relative&rsquo;s account number &lsquo;twice&rsquo; to be able to do both
types of transactions.</p>

<p>Also, you need to remember two passwords - one your online banking password,
and another, the &lsquo;profile&rsquo; password, where you can change your profile
settings. I don&rsquo;t know who came up with this idea of two passwords (both
requiring a special character, and a capital, and a digit, sigh) thinking it
might &lsquo;enhance&rsquo; security. Who cares about users anyway, right?</p>

<h2 id="icici:8e2dd647e7d0560715f28db5fe7e69c3">ICICI</h2>

<p>This bank recently completely refurbished its UI, and it&rsquo;s pretty good compared
to the old one. I was pretty impressed that a bank is really putting efforts
into improving the user experience, and not just introducing online banking
because all have it, and just be done with it. Only problem is, it thinks I&rsquo;m
dumb, and wants to force it&rsquo;s own unreasonable &lsquo;secure&rsquo; policies on me.</p>

<p>ICICI debit card has alphabet-digit combinations at the back. For example
A=23,B=01,C=81 upto P=44. Every time you have to do an online transaction, you
need to possess near you 1. Your mobile phone (where it will send an OTP (one
time password), and 2. Your debit card, so that you can enter digits for any
three randomly selected alphabets. I&rsquo;m not sure how the second part increases
security. The bank stops asking OTP once it knows that some specific IP is your
home computer, but still, the debit card alphabet thingy is mandatory. And you
know, there is NO option whatsoever to change this behavior.</p>

<p>There have been two cases when I needed to urgently transfer some amount, but the
poor OTP SMS got stuck somewhere on their servers and didn&rsquo;t reach me for the
whole freaking day.</p>

<h2 id="citibank:8e2dd647e7d0560715f28db5fe7e69c3">CitiBank</h2>

<p>For a couple of months, funnily, their site was not working on any browser except
Internet Explorer. Also, this bank also takes security too seriously. It
doesn&rsquo;t show you all the digits of your bank account (e.g. 1234xxxxxx9), and
does the same with all the account numbers of beneficiaries you added. So once
you add your friend as a beneficiary to this bank, and later you want to add
him/her to another bank, you cannot see his/her account number here by any
possible way. You need to ask him/her again his bank details, or store it
somewhere in your notepad, physical or virtual.</p>

<h2 id="common-problem:8e2dd647e7d0560715f28db5fe7e69c3">Common problem</h2>

<p>All of this don&rsquo;t frustrate me enough. What makes me really furious is
these banks have a habit of not sending an SMS when they debit my account for
maintenance charges or a default. Every other transaction, be it a 10 Rupee
mobile recharge, is accompanied with an SMS. Except when it&rsquo;s them who are
deducting the amount. SBI does it for annual debit card charges, Citibank
deducted 300 Rupees each month, for 4 months, when my account stopped
receiving any salary, without my attention. Turned out they changed my account
from &lsquo;suvidha&rsquo; to &lsquo;basic&rsquo; without my knowledge. And ICICI did that with me too,
debiting annual maintenance fee for the trading account, without a hint of me
noticing. Do they want me to keep checking the online transaction history once
in a while to catch my mistakes?</p>

<p>I consider this practice as ugly way of treating customers, and very very unfair, and should be stopped if the banks
have any moral sense left in them. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll some day use consumer forum (or
will I need to file a PIL maybe?)
to stop this fooling of common people by
these banks. For today, I have an excuse that I don&rsquo;t have enough time.</p>

<p>I am sure these are not the only banks which are below par in customer
satisfaction. India has always had this culture that you need to be just as
good as your competitors. If they are exploiting, you too can exploit upto the
same extent. These banks too don&rsquo;t seem to bother much about user satisfaction.
They are just trying to be as good as their competitors. They don&rsquo;t see this
that if they provide superior services than their rivals, a guy will never ever
leave them and won&rsquo;t think of opening another bank account in his life.</p>

<p>Comments welcome!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
