    <span class="post-date">Jan 2, 2013</span>
    
    <p>Listing down the things which went well for me in 2012, and which didn&rsquo;t, and the plans for upcoming year 2013. Beware: More technical stuff than emotional.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="things-which-went-well-in-2012">Things which went well in 2012</h2>

<h4 id="python">Python</h4>

<p>Started learning Python at the start of year 2012, early January, and this same language landed me in the job which I absolutely love: working in one of the biggest &lsquo;OpenSource&rsquo; project in the world, written in Python! Getting paid for working on an opensource project is as awesome as it can become for me.</p>

<h4 id="the-hunger-to-become-different-from-the-rest">The hunger to become different from the rest</h4>

<p>Gathered a lot of info on how things work in computer industry. Kept myself in contact with various hot topics, opensource projects.</p>

<h4 id="the-job">The job</h4>

<p>Not faring too well on this front - the full time job. But still, I would consider I did good enough with regards to the work assigned to me. I, after six months into the job, still goes to office every morning with a thirst to make a difference.</p>

<h4 id="cleanliness">Cleanliness</h4>

<p>Scored much better in the second half. Spent dedicated amount of time each week to keep my room and flat clean and in order.</p>

<h4 id="maintaining-a-todo-list">Maintaining a TODO list</h4>

<p>Started late in the year, but seems a good progress on that front.</p>

<h2 id="things-which-didn-t-go-that-well-in-2012">Things which didn&rsquo;t go that well in 2012</h2>

<h4 id="concentration">Concentration</h4>

<p>Still not able to concentrate on one thing for long. Get distracted too easily. Only rarely I sat at one place, focussed on one thing, for more than 50 minutes. Also, the last year&rsquo;s resolution of opening FaceBook only once a day was put in trashcan on in the very first week of January!</p>

<h4 id="not-focussed-enough-on-the-future-direction">Not focussed enough on the future direction</h4>

<p>Poor goal setting. Peeked into a lot of opensource projects, dedicated proper time into none. Opensourced my projects too, but did not work on it much either. Made myself a perfect example of &lsquo;naam bade aur darshan chhote&rsquo; (appearing like an eminent personality, acting like a jerk).</p>

<h4 id="programming-contest">Programming contest</h4>

<p>Only kept in touch. Not solved much problems. This year, need to focus a lot on this front.</p>

<h4 id="time-management">Time management</h4>

<p>Never was able to manage time. Was not working on the same thing for even a week. Somewhere in the middle of working on a project, I find out &lsquo;hey, this looks cool! Time to try hands on it!&rsquo;. What about the thingy you were currently working on? Into the TODO list! Such an idiot.</p>

<h4 id="work-life-balance">Work life balance</h4>

<p>Went for a toss. Not able to regularise job timings. Started and stopped gym. Started and stopped working on many projects. Completed none. Wasted a heck of a lot of time.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-upcoming-year">Plans for upcoming year</h2>

<h4 id="better-planning">Better planning</h4>

<p>I need to plan things before acting on it. I would take everything into consideration before jumping into hacking something, and then set a deadline for it. And till that deadline, I would promise I would not digress getting enticed by something which makes my mouth watery.</p>

<h4 id="don-t-just-outright-neglect-daytime-job">Don&rsquo;t just outright neglect daytime job</h4>

<p>I agree my daytime job is awesome. But I end up considering the work I do at office as secondary. Need to value it much higher. I concentrate on other projects and aim to complete and polish them. What I did not thought was the work I am doing in my job itself is a project! If I am not faring well in the project on which I work 8 hours a day, how can I expect myself to do good in something I am spending only a fraction of time I spend on the daytime project! And expectedly, none of my projects are in good enough shape to talk about it confidently in public. I need to value OpenStack more. Really.</p>

<h4 id="start-coding-for-programming-contests">START coding for programming contests</h4>

<p>Enough of promises, enough of &lsquo;From next month I&rsquo;m gonna do it&rsquo;. I SHOULD spend a specific time every week for coding for programming contests. Looks like I need to start with solving old problems from CodeChef.com alongwith the editorials provided with them.</p>

<h4 id="facebook-once-in-a-day">Facebook once in a day</h4>

<p>Period.</p>

<h4 id="need-to-plan-breaks-too">Need to plan breaks too</h4>

<p>Realised only the last month that opening facebook, checking out news, and reading articles on Hacker News does not count in a break. A break is not in front of a computer screen. A break is something which gives your strained eyes a rest, especially when you end up spending half of your year staring at a computer screen!</p>

<p>PS. The article is for the writer himself. It is okay if you are finding it a bad piece of English text.</p>
