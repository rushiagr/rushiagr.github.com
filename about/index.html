    <h1 class="post-title">About</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Rushi Agrawal, and I help companies succeed by <strong>creating great software</strong>.</p>

<p>I work as a software consultant and engineering lead at a startup. I code primarily in Python and shell scripts. I have brought two products of that startup to launch as a core engineer.</p>

<p>I created and contributed to a few open source projects too. Also, in my previous employment, I was the chief engineer for developing relational database service for their infrastructurec cloud.</p>

<p>Following are the consulting services I provide to my clients:</p>

<p><strong>Engineering</strong>: I write code from day one to tackle your tough problems. I have written code for developing ReST APIs for about a dozen different projects. I also have written front-end for five projects, four of them in web technologies and one in Android.</p>

<p><strong>Mentorship and code review</strong>: I help developers reach their full productivity by removing obstacles in their path and by empowering them with the resources and guidance they need.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture</strong>: I design architecture based on your requirements, with an eye on future scope of expansion of work as well as human resources. I make sure software quality is high regardless of the duration or value of the project. For example, depending upon your scale, I will tell you if a non-relational database is a better fit for your team, not only in terms of scaling but also in terms of different failure modes it introduces and operational cost of that database.</p>

<p>I have deep interest in distributed systems, especially distributed databases. However, I still think that a vast majority of engineering problems in this world can be solved by existing relational databases like PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>I graduated from IIT Hyderabad in 2012 with a Bachelors degree in Computer
Science and Engineering. Before that, I did my schooling from my hometown
Shegaon near Nagpur.</p>

<p>When not thinking about software, I watch and read about cricket. I also have
interest in social welfare and philanthrophy.</p>
