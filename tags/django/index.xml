      <description>I am writing Python code since 5 years, and I have worked with around 5-6 entry-level Python programmers. There is a pattern I can see in their programming practices. My hope is by reading this article there will be lesser such mistakes.
I have worked on OpenStack for over three years, which is written in Python and has a very high code quality, so I feel I am qualified enough to write this post.</description>
