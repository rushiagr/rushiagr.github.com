      <description>I am writing Python code since 5 years, and I have worked with around 5-6 entry-level Python programmers. There is a pattern I can see in their programming practices. My hope is by reading this article there will be lesser such mistakes.
I have worked on OpenStack for over three years, which is written in Python and has a very high code quality, so I feel I am qualified enough to write this post.</description>

      <description>Estimated reading time: 5 minutes.
Almost all IDEs today have &amp;lsquo;autosave&amp;rsquo; feature. That is, you don&#39;t need to explicitly save a file. The file is automatically saved as you type, so that even if your computer crashes, you don&#39;t lose data. This makes me wonder why Vim&#39;s default behavior is of using swap files. Swap files are annoying. I&#39;ve seen all Vim developers, including me, struggle with swap files at one point in their life.</description>

      <description>The problem You are trying to print a MySQL table with a large number of columns, with SELECT * command. You type SELECT * FROM mysql.user LIMIT 1, and your terminal becomes this. If you wanted to view more than one row, you&#39;re in a trouble :)
The solution Run MySQL with this option:
mysql --pager=&amp;quot;less --chop-long-lines --quit-if-one-screen --no-init&#39;  This will make your table display only the rows it can in the current screen, something like this.</description>
