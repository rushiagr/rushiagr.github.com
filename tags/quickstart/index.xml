      <title>Everything you need to know about Tmux copy paste - Ubuntu</title>

      <description>Copying from a Tmux session is something every Tmux user struggled with once. I&#39;m listing out all the stuff I learnt in this blog.
I tested everything on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, which runs Tmux version 1.8 (I have a few commands included for Tmux version 2+ also) To check your Tmux version, run tmux -V. If you have a Mac, see here.
Know about copy buffers When you do a CTRL`+`c, the stuff you copy is stored in your computer&#39;s buffer, called &amp;lsquo;clipboard&amp;rsquo; from where you can paste anywhere by doing a CTRL+&#39;v&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Copying from a Tmux session is something every Tmux user struggled with once. I&#39;m listing out all the stuff I learnt in this blog.
I tested everything on Mac OS X El Capitan. For Ubuntu/Linux guide, see here. Mac OS X El Capitan runs Tmux version 2.1. To check your Tmux version, run tmux -V.
Know about your terminal The default terminal which comes with Mac is pretty limiting. Instead of listing the limitations (and workarounds around it), I&#39;ll just say that before you proceed, please install iTerm 2 and start using that immediately.</description>

      <title>Tmux session shortcuts</title>
      <link>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2016/01/10/tmux-session-shortcuts/</link>

      <guid>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2016/01/10/tmux-session-shortcuts/</guid>
      <description>Tmux is awesome. But the session management commands are way too long for my liking. Listing all sessions is tmux list-sessions, attaching to a session mysession is tmux attach -t mysession, etc.
So I created a few functions and aliases, which can be found here.
The general idea is, all commands start with mx, which is basically a shortcut for &amp;lsquo;tMuX&amp;rsquo;. So mxl is to &amp;lsquo;l&#39;ist tmux sessions, mxa is to &amp;lsquo;a&#39;ttach to a tmux session, etc.</description>

      <title>Build VM Images using Diskimage-builder</title>
      <link>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2016/01/02/build-vm-image-using-diskimage-builder/</link>

      <guid>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2016/01/02/build-vm-image-using-diskimage-builder/</guid>
      <description>OpenStack has this nice tool diskimage-builderto create virtual machine images without the need of a cloud. These vm images can then be uploaded to cloud (e.g. in Glance for OpenStack cloud), and they become immediately usable. You can also create VMs in virtualbox from these images (though I don&#39;t remember exact steps to make the image work with VirtualBox. Do let me know if you get the VM working with VirtualBox/Vagrant)</description>

      <description>Update *: Blog updated to use latest way to install docker.  After reading about docker and containers, I thought let&#39;s try them out. Here are my notes. Obviously all of them are taken from Internet. Maybe this collection here will help someone start with docker faster than spending time searching all over the internet.
It assumes your base OS is Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (when was the last time you saw the codename spelled &amp;lsquo;Trusty Tahr&amp;rsquo; and not &amp;lsquo;Trusty&amp;rsquo;?</description>

      <title>Puppet installation from modules</title>

      <guid>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2014/09/14/puppet-installation-from-modules/</guid>
      <description>A quick example of how to use Puppet to install and manage MySQL. We&#39;ll download required Puppet modules from their git repositories.
Again, everything is tried on Ubuntu (14.04).
Make sure hostname -f shows your FQDN. Then install puppet
sudo apt-get install puppet  We&#39;ll use git submodules to manage different git repositories. But first, create our own repository
mkdir puppet-mysql cd puppet-mysql git init  Install Puppet modules stdlib and mysql into directory modules as git submodules.</description>

      <description>This post get&#39;s you started with iSCSI administration on an Ubuntu machine. Although I have used Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) version, it should work with Precise (12.04) too, with the latest packages.
Prerequisites Make sure you have atleast a little idea of what these terms mean: iSCSI, LUN, IQN, initiator, target and portal. Google and wikipedia are your friends.
A quick summary: There are two parts of iSCSI communication - initiator and target.</description>

      <title>OpenStack Unit Testing Nuggets</title>

      <guid>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2014/09/05/openstack-unit-testing-nuggets/</guid>
      <description>A small post about little things I found out while running unit tests in OpenStack.
Unit-testing setup Everybody knows ./run_tests.sh is used to run the unit tests of an OpenStack project. But, you require to install dependencies before doing it. And installing dependencies might not always succeed. So make sure you install these packages before running pip install -r requirements.txt:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev \ python-dev libxslt1-dev libpq-dev python-mysqldb \ libmysqlclient-dev libvirt-dev  Atleast cinder and nova dependencies will get installed properly after this.</description>

      <description>OpenStack has support for EC2 API, that is, you can fire Amazon&#39;s API against an OpenStack cloud and it will still work. This article gets you started with using them locally against DevStack. It is more of a starter guide to a novice.
Fire a DevStack with it&#39;s default settings. See this post for more information on it.
git clone http://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack cd devstack/ ./stack.sh  Source openrc
source openrc  View all EC2 credentials available for the current user (here, demo user in demo tenant)</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you found out a cool new technology &amp;ldquo;OpenStack&amp;rdquo; and want to try it real quick? Or probably you are hired in a company for your Python skills and now you are supposed to work on OpenStack in the shortest possible time? Fear not, it is not that hard to get started. &lt;a href=&#34;http://devstack.org&#34;&gt;DevStack&lt;/a&gt; is your friend-in-need. No, don&#39;t click that hyperlink just yet :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Databases are so important, yet almost all the time I need to work with it, I find that I have already forgotten all the syntax! So here I am writing down a quick cheat sheet to get me up and running when I&#39;m waking up from slumber. I hope this will help atleast one other guy on this planet.
I use mostly Ubuntu, so some of the commands might be Ubuntu specific.</description>

      <title>Quick Start: Linux Logical Volume Manager</title>

      <description>While installing the latest Ubuntu OS on your computer, you will see that you can install the OS using LVM (Logical Volume Manager) utility. Ever wonder what is it? LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is that fantastic utility for storage administration. It provide the users with abilities which were not possible with raw disks. The storage is now &amp;lsquo;virtualized&amp;rsquo;. You can now easily create, move and extend volumes (for now, think of it as disk partitions) without bothering about data corruption.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post covers all the important commands for OpenStack Cinder - The block storage project.
Although this guide is written based on DevStack, it will work with actual deployment of OpenStack
cloud also (except the DevStack/Linux specific bits).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UPDATE(April 2014): Now when you set up DevStack, Tempest is automatically set up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick start guide explains setting up Tempest with a DevStack environment
for Grizzly release. Most of the information here is taken from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joinfu.com/2012/03/testing-essex-rc1-with-devstack-and-tempest/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the only difference being this blog post is more recent, and is based on Grizzly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
