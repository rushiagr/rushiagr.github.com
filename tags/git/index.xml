      <description>I am writing Python code since 5 years, and I have worked with around 5-6 entry-level Python programmers. There is a pattern I can see in their programming practices. My hope is by reading this article there will be lesser such mistakes.
I have worked on OpenStack for over three years, which is written in Python and has a very high code quality, so I feel I am qualified enough to write this post.</description>

      <title>Git(hub) Cheat Sheet</title>
      <link>http://www.rushiagr.com/blog/2013/03/19/github-cheat-sheet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am posting my github cheat sheet here. I started writing it as soon as I started
learning Github and Git. So, some of the content here can appear quite naive.
I will try to keep this blog post as updated as I can, and if you find any
suggestion, please comment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is just for a reference of commands. This post will be a bad way to learn
how git works. A basic understanding of git is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
