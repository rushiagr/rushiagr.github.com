      <description>TL;DR: Know how to install and set up Squid proxy, so that you can cache packages, and hence save bandwidth if you want to install those packages again and again. Also works if you are already behind a squid proxy.
Problem: Repetitive download. Slow. If you deal with virtual machines a lot, you might know the pain of managing packages on each one of them. Every time I had to create a new VM, I would run apt-get update (to get information about all the latest packages available for my Ubuntu system), apt-get dist-upgrade (to install latest versions of all packages already installed), and also install some packages not present in stock Ubuntu image, like git (yes, it&#39;s 2015 and Ubuntu still doesn&#39;t come pre-installed with git), ipython, bwm-ng and some others.</description>
