      <description>Below are steps to create an express setup of Kubernetes on your Mac for quick use.
Minikube is a small setup by Kubernetes guys, which will spawn a virtual machine and have a tiny (but fully functional) Kubernetes cluster inside the VM. kubectl (pronounced &amp;lsquo;kube (like &amp;lsquo;tube&amp;rsquo;) control`) is the command line client you&#39;ll use to connect to the Kubernetes cluster (which runs inside the VM created by minikube, in case you forgot :) )</description>

      <description>I was looking for a better theme for my blog which is based on Pelican static site generator in Python, but then I happened to look at this blog written in Hugo - a Go counterpart of Pelican. The thing which caught my eye was the posts page, which is exactly how I wanted my first page to be. I&#39;ve always wanted something like Paul Graham&#39;s essays page, but couldn&#39;t find anything close to it until I found this site.</description>
